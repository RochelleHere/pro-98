#  #   Define a swapFileData function using def
# #Use inputs to take the names of the files to swap.
# #Open file1 and read itâ€™s data and save it in a variable called data_a.
# #Open file2 and read its data and save it in a variable called data_b.
# Open file 1 in writing mode and write data_b to it.
# Open file 2 in writing mode and write data_a to it.
# Call the function.
# Save the code.
